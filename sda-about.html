                                    Switzerland) is a graphic designer and programmer, living and working in Lugano. He
                                    studied visual communication in Lugano under Bruno Monguzzi and graduated in 2000.

                                    research projects without a particular purpose. They combine disciplines from the
                                    field of visual communication, architecture and technology. Recent work explores
                                    images and patterns using the geometries of multipurpose displays, urban signage and
                                    found or forgotten objects. Andreas holds lectures and gives workshops in different

                                <p>Ulrike Hug-Stüwe (b. 1976 in Berlin, Germany) is Head of Photo Lifestyle for <em>Neue
                                        Zürcher Zeitung</em>’s <em>Z Magazin, NZZ am Sonntag Magazin</em> and online
                                    platform bellevue.nzz.com and jointly responsible for visual content in the areas of
                                    fashion, design and lifestyle. Her main interest as a (picture) editor lies in who
                                    does what and how, what has been and what is yet to come. She favours diversity
                                    nationally and internationally, refusing to impose values or succumb to tunnel
                                    vision. Fashion design is her main focus.</p>
                                <p>Ulrike views fashion design as socially progressive, direct and accessible. It
                                    affects everyone to some extent – as a phenomenon, an economic force, a means of
                                    expression, a reflection of the zeitgeist or a driver of technical and craft
                                    innovation with regard to materials, processing and manufacturing. Ulrike does not
                                    see fashion and textile design as separate fields but as a sum of design, artistic
                                    and social phenomena.</p>
                                <p>She has previously worked for <em>Annabelle</em> magazine and the now defunct
                                    <em>Friday</em>. Prior to that, she was a producer of photographic works around the
                                    world for a photography agency. As a guest lecturer at the Lucerne University of
                                    Applied Sciences and Arts, the Bern University of the Arts and the Bern School of
                                    Design, she teaches visual dramaturgy in journalism, particularly in fashion and
                                    lifestyle photography, as well as semiotics and regularly provides photography
                                    students with expert input in portfolio discussions. She began her studies in Berlin
                                    before moving to Switzerland in 1999 and graduating as a designer in visual
                                    communication, specialising in art and design theory.</p>
